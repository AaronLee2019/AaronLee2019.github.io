Traffic forecasting is a crucial task for enhancing the quality and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, several neural networks have been proposed to tackle this challenge. However, traffic data itself has complex composition and intertwined temporal patterns. Currently, the absence of effective methods to capture the inherent properties and overall profile of traffic data has become a bottleneck in improving the traffic prediction capabilities of models. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, Decomposition with Feature Attention and Graph Convolution Network (DFAGCN), for Traffic Forecasting. To highlight the inherent properties of complicated traffic data, we present a unique Decomposition with Feature Attention (DFA) method to decompose the traffic data into seasonality, trend, and remainder. On the one hand, we introduce a new method to filter out noise and possible outliers from time series data. On the other hand, we employ an attention mechanism to make our decomposition method adaptively extract the trend. Subsequently, we utilize spatial–temporal attention to simulate the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations of traffic data. Finally, we use spatial–temporal convolution to extract local dependencies of traffic data. Experiments conducted on four real-world traffic forecasting datasets demonstrate that DFAGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results show that the application of time series decomposition to traffic data significantly enhances the accuracy of traffic prediction.
