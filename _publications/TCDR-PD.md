Graph neural network-based approaches have achieved remarkable success in temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning. Despite these advances, two critical challenges remain: (1) inadequate modeling of local contextual dynamics, which limits the adaptability of entity and relation representations to specific queries; and (2) inadequate mechanisms for handling emerging patterns, i.e., novel interactions absent from historical data, which reduces predictive performance in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose TCDR-PD, a Temporal and Contextual Dynamic Representation Network with Pattern Decomposition. TCDR-PD introduces a Temporal and Contextual Dynamic Representation (TCDR)module to capture both global temporal trends and query-specific contextual dynamics, enabling more precise embeddings. Additionally, the Pattern Decomposition (PD) prediction module explicitly disentangles the prediction of recurring and emerging patterns, enabling tailored strategies to improve reasoning performance. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TCDR-PD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively supporting stable reasoning over evolving TKGs.
